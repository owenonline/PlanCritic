The goal of this satellite observation problem is to capture specific images using two satellites, satellite0 and satellite1, equipped with various instruments. Satellite0 and satellite1 need to point their instruments towards certain celestial directions and phenomena, such as Star3, Star4, Phenomenon5, and Phenomenon7, to capture images in specified modes such as infrared0 and spectrograph2. This involves a sequence of actions, including turning the satellites to the required directions, switching instruments on and off, calibrating them to ensure accuracy, and finally taking the images. Achieving the goal requires careful management of the satellites' power resources while adhering to the constraints of the instruments' capabilities, such as which modes they support and which directions they can be calibrated towards. The problem also includes a temporal element, as the objective is to minimize the total time taken to complete all tasks, making efficient scheduling and execution of actions crucial for success.
