The goal of this problem is to manage the operation of two satellites, satellite0 and satellite1, to capture images in various modes and directions while minimizing the total time taken. Satellite0 and satellite1 are equipped with instruments, specifically, instrument0 is on board satellite0, while instrument1 and instrument2 are on board satellite1. Each instrument can support multiple modes such as infrared0, infrared1, and thermograph2, and require calibration targeting specific directions like Star0 and Star2. The satellites can be pointed toward various celestial or terrestrial directions, including Star6, Planet5, and Phenomenon9, to capture the desired images. Key actions include turning the satellites to the correct direction, switching instruments on and off, calibrating them, and finally, capturing images. The satellites must manage their power availability, as actions like switching instruments on reduce the available power, which can be restored by switching them off. The ultimate goal is to achieve a set of conditions where satellite1 is pointing at Planet5 and images are captured in specified modes across multiple directions, such as Planet3 with infrared1 and Phenomenon8 with thermograph2.
