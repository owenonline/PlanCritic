The goal of the problem is to capture images of specific celestial directions using a satellite system equipped with an instrument, all while minimizing the total time taken to achieve these captures. The environment involves a single satellite, satellite0, which is currently pointing towards Phenomenon6. It has onboard an instrument, instrument0, that supports the thermograph0 mode. The satellite is initially powered, and the instrument requires calibration using GroundStation2 as the calibration target. The task is to obtain images in the thermograph0 mode of Phenomenon4, Star5, and Phenomenon6. To accomplish this, the satellite must manage its pointing direction, switch its instrument on and off to handle power constraints, and ensure the instrument is calibrated before taking images. The dynamics of the environment involve durative actions such as turning the satellite to different directions, switching the instrument on to make it ready for calibration and image capture, calibrating the instrument with a specific target, and finally capturing the desired images. Each of these actions has specified durations and conditions that must be met for successful execution, emphasizing the need for strategic planning to achieve the goal within the shortest possible time.
