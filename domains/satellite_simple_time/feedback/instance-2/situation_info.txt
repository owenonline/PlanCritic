The goal of the problem is to utilize the satellite, satellite0, equipped with two instruments, instrument0 and instrument1, to capture images of various celestial and terrestrial objects in different modes. The satellite must achieve images of Planet3, Planet4, Phenomenon5, Phenomenon6, and Star7 in the specified modes: infrared0 and image2. The satellite environment is dynamic, requiring careful management of its pointing direction and power resources. The satellite initially points at Planet4 and has power available for operation. The instruments must be powered on and calibrated before taking images, and the satellite must be pointing in the correct direction for the intended target. The actions in the environment, such as turning the satellite to a new direction, switching instruments on and off, calibrating instruments, and capturing images, have defined durations and conditions, which must be managed to minimize the total time taken to achieve the goal. The instruments have specific capabilities, with instrument0 supporting modes infrared0 and infrared1, and instrument1 capable of modes infrared0, infrared1, and image2. Additionally, each instrument has a specific calibration target: instrument0 with Star0 and instrument1 with GroundStation2, which also influences the preparation steps needed before image capture.
