The goal of the problem is to ensure that the waterway from the initial waypoint (wpt_ini) to the end waypoint (wpt_end) is cleared of debris and that the ship (shp_0) is salvaged and safely docked at the ship dock (shp_dck_0). Additionally, the debris asset (deb_ast_0), scout asset (sct_ast_0), and ship salvage asset (shp_sal_ast_0) must all return to their initial location (wpt_ini) by the end of the task. The environment contains both normal debris (e.g., n_deb_ini_a_0, n_deb_a_0_a_1) and underwater debris (e.g., u_deb_ini_b_0, u_deb_b_0_b_1) that block various waypoints along two paths: one through waypoints wpt_a_0 to wpt_a_2 and another through waypoints wpt_b_0 to wpt_b_2. The debris asset is responsible for removing visible debris, while the scout asset must first scout locations to detect and make underwater debris visible before the debris asset can remove it. The ship salvage asset is tasked with salvaging the shipwreck and towing it to the ship dock. Locations may be restricted, and only the relevant authority (aut_a or aut_b) can make these locations unrestricted to allow traversal. The dynamics of the environment involve constraints such as asset speed, debris removal rates, capacity limits, and connectivity between locations. The problem must be solved within an optimized time frame, minimizing the total time taken to achieve the goal.
