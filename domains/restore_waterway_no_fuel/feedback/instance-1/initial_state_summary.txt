* `sct_ast_0` is at location `wpt_ini`.
* `shp_sal_ast_0` is at location `wpt_ini`.
* `n_deb_ini_a_0` is at locations `wpt_ini` and `wpt_a_0`.
* `n_deb_a_0_end` is at locations `wpt_a_0` and `wpt_end`.
* `u_deb_ini_b_0` is at locations `wpt_ini` and `wpt_b_0`.
* `u_deb_b_0_end` is at locations `wpt_b_0` and `wpt_end`.
* The ship is at location `wpt_ini`.

**Debris Constraints:**

* `n_deb_ini_a_0` has a weight of 100 kg.
* `n_deb_a_0_end` has a weight of 100 kg.
* `u_deb_ini_b_0` has a weight of 100 kg.
* `u_deb_b_0_end` has a weight of 100 kg.

**Authority Constraints:**

* `aut_a` has authority over location `wpt_a_0`.
* `aut_b` has authority over location `wpt_b_0`.
* The reply time for `aut_a` is 0.1 hours.
* The reply time for `aut_b` is 0.1 hours.

**Asset Constraints:**

* `deb_ast_0` has a speed of 10 km/h and can remove debris at a normal rate of 100 kg/h, underwater rate of 50 kg/h, and unload rate of 2000 kg/h.
* `sct_ast_0` has a speed of 20 km/h and can scout for 1 hour.
* `shp_sal_ast_0` has a speed of 10 km/h and can dock for 1 hour, salvage for 1 hour, and tow ships.
