I'd be happy to help summarize the PDDL constraints.

**Distance Constraints:**

There are 8 distance constraints, specifying that the distances between certain waypoints are 10 units each:

* wpt_ini and wpt_b_0
* wpt_b_0 and wpt_ini
* wpt_b_0 and wpt_b_1
* wpt_b_1 and wpt_b_0
* wpt_b_1 and wpt_b_2
* wpt_b_2 and wpt_b_1
* wpt_b_2 and wpt_end
* wpt_end and wpt_b_2

**Ship Predicates:**

There are 2 ship predicates:

* shp_0 is a shipwreck (is_shipwreck)
* shp_0 is at location wpt_end (at)

**Asset Predicates:**

There are several asset predicates, including:

* deb_ast_0 is not damaged (is_asset_not_damaged)
* sct_ast_0 is not damaged
* shp_sal_ast_0 is not damaged
* deb_ast_0 is not moving (is_asset_not_moving)
* sct_ast_0 is not moving
* shp_sal_ast_0 is not moving
* Additional predicates for debris, scout, and ship salvage assets

**Asset Locations:**

Assets are located at certain waypoints:

* deb_ast_0 is at wpt_ini
* sct_ast_0 is at wpt_ini
* shp_sal_ast_0 is at wpt_ini

**Asset Functions:**

Several functions define characteristics of the assets, including:

* asset speeds (10 km/h for deb_ast_0 and shp_sal_ast_0, 20 km/h for sct_ast_0)
* debris capacity (1000 kg for deb_ast_0)
* debris unload rate (2000 kg/h for deb_ast_0)
* debris weight (initially 0 kg for deb_ast_0)
* normal debris removal rate (100 kg/h for deb_ast_0)
* underwater debris removal rate (50 kg/h for deb_ast_0)
* scout and ship salvage asset characteristics

**Debris Predicates:**

Several predicates define the locations of normal and underwater debris:

* Normal debris is located at waypoints wpt_a_0, wpt_a_1, wpt_a_2, and wpt_end
* Underwater debris is located at waypoints wpt_b_0, wpt_b_1, wpt_b_2, and wpt_end

**Debris Weights:**

The weights of the normal and underwater debris are defined:

* Normal debris weighs 100 kg each
* Underwater debris weighs 100 kg each

**Authority Predicates:**

There are authority predicates defining which authorities have control over certain locations:

* aut_a has authority over wpt_a_0, wpt_a_1, and wpt_a_2
* aut_b has authority over wpt_b_0, wpt_b_1, and wpt_b_2

**Authority Reply Times:**

The reply times for the authorities are defined:

* aut_a replies in 0.1 hours
* aut_b replies in 0.1 hours
