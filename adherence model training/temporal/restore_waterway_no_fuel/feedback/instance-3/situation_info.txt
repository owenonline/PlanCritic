In this problem, the goal is to restore the waterway by removing both normal and underwater debris, and salvaging a shipwreck from waypoint `wpt_end` to the ship dock `shp_dck_0`. The environment consists of various locations including waypoints (`wpt_ini`, `wpt_end`, `wpt_a_0`, `wpt_a_1`, `wpt_a_2`, `wpt_b_0`, `wpt_b_1`, `wpt_b_2`), a debris station (`deb_stn_0`), and a ship dock (`shp_dck_0`). The assets involved in this task include a debris asset (`deb_ast_0`), a scout asset (`sct_ast_0`), and a ship salvage asset (`shp_sal_ast_0`). The debris asset removes debris from the waypoints and unloads it at the debris station, while the scout asset is responsible for detecting and making underwater debris visible. The ship salvage asset salvages the shipwreck and tows it to the ship dock. The authorities (`aut_a` and `aut_b`) control access to certain waypoints and must make them unrestricted to allow asset traversal. The dynamics of the environment involve moving assets between locations, removing debris, scouting for underwater debris, and salvaging and docking the shipwreck, all while adhering to the constraints of asset capabilities and locations being unblocked and unrestricted. The ultimate objective is to ensure that all debris is cleared and the shipwreck is successfully docked, allowing for free traversal between `wpt_a_2` and `wpt_end` as well as `wpt_b_2` and `wpt_end`.
