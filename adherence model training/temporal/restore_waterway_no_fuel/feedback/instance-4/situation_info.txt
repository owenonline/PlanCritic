The goal of the problem is to restore the waterway by clearing debris and salvaging a shipwreck. Specific tasks include removing both normal debris and underwater debris from various waypoints, making sure that all routes between critical waypoints are unblocked, and finally towing the salvaged ship to a designated ship dock. The environment consists of several locations such as `wpt_ini`, `wpt_end`, `wpt_a_0`, `wpt_b_0`, `deb_stn_0`, and `shp_dck_0`. Each location might be connected or blocked by debris. Various assets are used to achieve the goals, including `deb_ast_0` (a debris asset), `sct_ast_0` (a scout asset), and `shp_sal_ast_0` (a ship salvage asset). The `deb_ast_0` is responsible for removing debris, `sct_ast_0` for scouting underwater debris to make it visible, and `shp_sal_ast_0` for salvaging and towing the shipwreck `shp_0`. Authorities `aut_a` and `aut_b` control access to some locations, and their approval is required to make these locations unrestricted for traversal. The problem is considered solved when all debris is cleared from the pathways and the shipwreck is successfully moved to `shp_dck_0`, with all assets returned to their initial location `wpt_ini`.
