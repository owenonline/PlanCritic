Here is a summary of the PDDL constraints:

**Asset Constraints**

* `deb_ast_0` is not moving, not removing debris, and not unloading debris.
* `sct_ast_0` is not scouting.
* `shp_sal_ast_0` is not docking, salvaging, or towing ships.

**Location Constraints**

* All assets (`deb_ast_0`, `sct_ast_0`, and `shp_sal_ast_0`) are at location `wpt_ini`.

**Functional Constraints**

* Asset speeds: `deb_ast_0` = 10 km/h, `sct_ast_0` = 20 km/h, `shp_sal_ast_0` = 10 km/h.
* Debris asset properties:
	+ Debris capacity: 1000 kg
	+ Debris unload rate: 2000 kg/h
	+ Initial debris weight: 0 kg
	+ Normal debris removal rate: 100 kg/h
	+ Underwater debris removal rate: 50 kg/h
* Scout asset property: scout time = 1 h.
* Ship salvage asset properties:
	+ Dock time: 1 h
	+ Salvage time: 1 h

**Debris Constraints**

* Normal debris locations: `n_deb_ini_a_0` is at `wpt_ini` and `wpt_a_0`, while `n_deb_a_0_end` is at `wpt_a_0` and `wpt_end`.
* Underwater debris locations: `u_deb_ini_b_0` is at `wpt_ini` and `wpt_b_0`, while `u_deb_b_0_end` is at `wpt_b_0` and `wpt_end`.
* Debris weights:
	+ Normal debris: 1500 kg (initial), 100 kg (final)
	+ Underwater debris: 1500 kg (initial), 100 kg (final)

**Authority Constraints**

* Authority over locations: `aut_a` has authority over `wpt_a_0`, while `aut_b` has authority over `wpt_b_0`.
* Reply times:
	+ `aut_a`: 0.1 h
	+ `aut_b`: 0.1 h
