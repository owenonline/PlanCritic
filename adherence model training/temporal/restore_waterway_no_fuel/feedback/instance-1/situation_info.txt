The goal of this problem is to ensure the waterway is clear of debris and shipwrecks, allowing for smooth navigation from the initial waypoint, `wpt_ini`, to the final waypoint, `wpt_end`. Specifically, the normal debris located at `wpt_a_0` and `wpt_end`, as well as the underwater debris located at `wpt_b_0` and `wpt_end`, must be removed or made visible to facilitate the movement of debris assets. The shipwreck at `wpt_end`, labeled `shp_0`, needs to be salvaged and docked at `shp_dck_0`. The debris asset, `deb_ast_0`, starts at `wpt_ini` and is responsible for removing both normal and underwater debris, with the scout asset, `sct_ast_0`, assisting by scouting for underwater debris to make it visible. The ship salvage asset, `shp_sal_ast_0`, also starts at `wpt_ini` and is tasked with salvaging and towing the shipwreck to the ship dock. Authorities `aut_a` and `aut_b` control restrictions over `wpt_a_0` and `wpt_b_0` respectively, which need to be made unrestricted to allow asset traversal. The dynamics of the environment involve coordinating the actions of these assets, ensuring they are not damaged, moving, or performing conflicting tasks simultaneously, while adhering to the constraints of location connections, visibility, and debris capacity.
